implement: /path/to/plan-file.md

Additional requirements: 

- A demo is required for this phase of implementation. 
- aim for 90%+ test coverage
- after making the changes, use specs/build_toolchain.md to build, then run tests. If spec/build_toolchain.md doesn't exist, create it with best known approach
- commit changes; NEVER add Co-Authored-By to the commit information or docs
- If possible, build the docker image using docker-compose and start it with information on how to access it
